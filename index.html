    This is my very first website so <b>let me introduce myself first!!! </b>

    <p>
        I'm Raiza and I come from a close and supportive family that has helped shape who I am. We value honesty,
        respect, and always
        being there for each other, both in good times and hard times. Growing up this way taught me the importance of
        understanding, good communication, and staying grounded.
    </p>

    <p>
        My family and I share a strong bond built on trust and care. They encourage me to grow, be true to myself, and
        move forward with confidence. Their support has played a big part in my life, and I carry what they’ve taught me
        with me every day.

        <h2>A short quote plus a meaningful lesson</h2>
        In <a href="https://www.google.com" target="blank">The Alchemist</a> by Paulo Coelho, the story teaches that
        following your
        dreams takes courage, patience, and faith in yourself. The book reminds readers that fear is often the biggest
        obstacle to success, not failure itself. One of its most powerful lines is, “When you want something, all the
        universe conspires in helping you achieve it.” The lesson of the book is that listening to your heart and
        staying committed to your purpose can lead you to a meaningful and fulfilled life.<br>
    </strong>

    <ul>
        <li>"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it."</li>
        <li>"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure."</li>
        <li>"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself."</li>
        <li>"It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting."</li>
        <li>"People are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of."</li>
    </ul>
